    "_**Supervised Learning with Gradient Boosted Trees: A Binary Prediction Problem With Unbalanced Classes**_\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "Direct marketing, either through mail, email, phone, etc., is a common tactic to acquire customers.  Because resources and a customer's attention is limited, the goal is to only target the subset of prospects who are likely to engage with a specific offer.  Predicting those potential customers based on readily available information like demographics, past interactions, and environmental factors is a common machine learning problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook presents an example problem to predict if a customer will enroll for a term deposit at a bank, after one or more phone calls.  The steps include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Preparing your Amazon SageMaker notebook\n",
    "* Downloading data from the internet into Amazon SageMaker\n",
    "* Investigating and transforming the data so that it can be fed to Amazon SageMaker algorithms\n",
    "* Estimating a model using the Gradient Boosting algorithm\n",
    "* Evaluating the effectiveness of the model\n",
    "* Setting the model up to make on-going predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "_This notebook was created and tested on an ml.m4.xlarge notebook instance._\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by specifying:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The S3 bucket and prefix that you want to use for training and model data.  This should be within the same region as the Notebook Instance, training, and hosting.\n",
    "- The IAM role arn used to give training and hosting access to your data. See the documentation for how to create these.  Note, if more than one role is required for notebook instances, training, and/or hosting, please replace the boto regexp with a the appropriate full IAM role arn string(s)."

In some cases, simply taking the natural log of the features is sufficient to produce more normally distributed data.  In others, bucketing values into discrete ranges is helpful.  These buckets can then be treated as categorical variables and included in the model when one hot encoded.\n",

    "\n",
    "- `rules`: This new parameter will accept a list of rules you wish to evaluate against the tensors output by this training job.\n",
    "  For rules, Amazon SageMaker Debugger supports two types:\n",
    "  - SageMaker Rules: These are rules specially curated by the data science and engineering teams in Amazon SageMaker which you can opt to evaluate against your training job.\n",
    "  - Custom Rules: You can optionally choose to write your own rule as a Python source file and have it evaluated against your training job.\n",
    "    To provide Amazon SageMaker Debugger to evaluate this rule, you would have to provide the S3 location of the rule source and the evaluator image.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, you will use a Amazon SageMaker's LossNotDecreasing rule, which helps you identify if you are running into a situation where the training loss is not going down.\n",

    "- `rule_parameters`: In this parameter, you provide the runtime values of the parameter in your constructor.\n",

    "  In this example, you will use Amazon SageMaker's LossNotDecreasing rule to monitor the `metircs` collection.\n",
